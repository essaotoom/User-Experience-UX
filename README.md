**Abstract**

Software User Experience (UX) reveals product impressions when using or planning to utilize a software product. However, software products are notorious for their uncertainty, adaptability, and continuous operation. Users often evaluate the software UX based on a particular system release or a prototype. Although there is much machine research, little research has been conducted on UX prediction based on requirements items. Moreover, developing a UX-oriented prototype at early software requirements elicitation is time-consuming and laborious. Given a list of initial textual requirements, predicting a system UX Key Performance Indicator (KPI) is essential for success and saving project efforts. This study assesses an application's UX KPI in the first phases of software requirements engineering. Our suggested machine learning algorithms extract UX characteristics from textual requirements to categorize them as UX scales. The anticipated UX scales are then used to forecast the total UX KPI of any software application. The UX predictions should be reliable compared to a real case study of different application prototypes. We trained several machine learning models on a benchmark dataset of software requirements. The models were tested, showing a high performance of the f1-measure, which was 0.91 for the Random Forest Algorithm. Besides, the UX KPIs calculated based on outputs from machine learning models were highly interrelated with those calculated based on our developed software prototypes. Therefore, the proposed approach is automatic, easy to implement, and reliable in estimating the overall application UX before development. We conclude that the new model can evaluate UX instantly without interventions from end-users or UX designers.
